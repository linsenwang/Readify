# Welcome to Readify

Readify is a tool to transform all kinds of file in txt.

You can throw txt, srt/vtt, all kinds of audio file or URL of Youtube/Bilibili videos in to this.

For example:

```sh
readify 'your-file-dir'
``` 

```sh
readify 'https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1DH4y1c7gK'
``` 

## How it works?

This project is just a workflow of some mature tools, which decrease the manial file convert and provide a task manager to restart unfinish task.
